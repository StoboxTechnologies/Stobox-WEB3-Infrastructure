#### **External Reader**
An address granted temporary read access to a specific DID. Access is time-limited and controlled by the DID owner with defined expiration dates.

**Reader Capabilities (while access is valid):**
- `readAttributeList()` - View attribute keys associated with the DID
- `readLinkedAddresses()` - View addresses currently linked to the DID
- `readFullDID()` - Retrieve complete DID data structure

**Access Control:** `externalReaderExpirationDate > block.timestamp`

### View Methods:

**DID Information:**
- `getUserDID(address walletAddress)` - Retrieves DID details for a wallet address (returns: UDID, validTo, updatedAt, blocked, lastUpdatedBy)
- `getLinker(address walletAddress)` - Retrieves linker information for an address (returns: uDID, joinDate, updateDate, deactivated)

**Attribute Information:**
- `getAttribute(address walletAddress, string attributeName)` - Retrieves specific attribute details (returns: value, valueType, createdAt, updatedAt, validTo, lastUpdatedBy)

**Access Verification:**
- `canRead(string uDIDToRead, address addressCanRead)` - Checks if address has permission to read DID attributes
- `externalReaderExpirationDate(string uDID, address walletAddress)` - Returns expiration timestamp for external reader access

### Write Methods:

**DID Lifecycle Management:**

## 6. [StoboxRWAOfferingRegistry SC](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb05cf4f652eb5475c3e4246ab976785678a1806a#code) (offering management & compliance registry)

- **Role:** Manages registration, lifecycle, and compliance validation for Security Token Offerings (STOs) tied to Real World Assets (RWAs).
  - Handles complete lifecycle: creation, activation, suspension, cancellation, termination of offerings.
  - Enforces compliance via a flexible rule engine and role-based access controls.
- **Architecture:** Built using EIP-2535 Diamond Pattern for upgradability and modular facets:
  - **DiamondCutFacet** – Handles upgrades and facet management.
  - **DiamondLoupeFacet** – Provides introspection and facet/query logic.
  - **RegistryRoleFacet** – Manages user roles and permissions (admin, tech service, offering manager, etc).
  - **OfferingGovernanceFacet** – Offering lifecycle management and governance.
  - **RegistryStorageFacet** – Reliable data storage and retrieval for offerings.
  - **RegistryRuleEngineFacet** – Enforces and manages offerings' compliance rules.
- **Interaction:**
  - Integrates with **StoboxProtocolSTV3 SC** for security token management.
  - Pulls identity data from **StoboxDID SC** via validation rules (e.g., AccreditedUSMinInvestmentRule).
  - Enables offering registration and compliance enforcement through custom rules and whitelisting.
  - Can lock and unlock security tokens based on offering state.
- **Deployed at:**
  - **Mainnet:** [`0xb05cf4f652eb5475c3e4246ab976785678a1806a`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb05cf4f652eb5475c3e4246ab976785678a1806a#code) ([v1.0.1 release notes](./ST4RWAOfferingRegistry-Release-Notes.md))
- **Status:** Implemented; see [release notes](./ST4RWAOfferingRegistry-Release-Notes.md) and [contract source](https://github.com/StoboxTechnologies/ST4RWAOfferingRegistry).

## Flow Summary

1. **StoboxRWAVaultFactory SC** creates both the **STV3Treasury SC** and **StoboxProtocolSTV3 SC**.
2. **StoboxRWAVaultFactory SC** manages the deployed protocol contracts.
3. **StoboxProtocolSTV3 SC** interacts with **Validation HasDIDRule SC** to check compliance.
4. **Validation HasDIDRule SC** queries **StoboxDID SC** to verify decentralized identities.
5. **StoboxRWAOfferingRegistry SC** manages STO lifecycle and compliance validation, integrating with the full RWA ecosystem.

---

**Integration Highlights:**
- The **StoboxRWAOfferingRegistry SC** is designed to coordinate with the full RWA ecosystem:
  - When a new offering is created, it can assign roles, configure compliance rules, require investors to meet identity/KYC requirements (via rules engine and DID checks), and manage token reservation.
  - The registry acts as a unified point of compliance, history, and role enforcement for all RWA offerings on Stobox.
